Trend:
1. Time trend: clear trend  
2. Seasonal: up and down spike
3. Cyclical: business cycle (Recession: 2 quarters, Depression: 4 quarters)
4. Autocorelation: when a variable rises/falls, it rises/falls for some times.
5. Randomness; Random components of the variable after filtered out other variables.

Others:
- Structural break: sharp drop in variable and stay there for a long period of time.
- Outlier: 1 point of data is 3 standard deviations from the mean.


\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    PV & = \frac{R_1}{(1+r)^1} + \frac{R_2}{(1+r)^2} + ... + \frac{R_n}{(1+r)^n} \\
    NPV & = Initial Investment - PV \\
    IRR & = \text {Find root of NPV = 0, use polyroot}  \\
    P_{Perpetuity} & = \frac{R}{r} \\
    \text {continuous Compounding } S & = A*e^{rt}  \\
    \text {Arithmetic Progression } S & = n(a+ \frac{d*(n-1)}{2})  \text { where the series is: } a, a+d, a+2d, .., a+ (n-1)d\\
    \text {Geometric Progression } S & = \frac{a(1-r^n)}{1-r} \text { where the series is  } a, ar^1, ar^2, ..., ar^{n-1} \\
    \text {Price Elasticity of Demand } & = \frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta P}  \\
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Comparing to sample mean: $z = \frac{x - \overline x}{SD}$
Standard error is standard deviation of sample means $SE = SD_{xbar} = \frac{SD}{\sqrt{n}}$ with $z = \frac{\overline x - \mu}{SE}$
