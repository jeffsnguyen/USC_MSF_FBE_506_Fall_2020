##### Question 1
##### a. Solve $x^2 +2x -8 =0$

Solving polynomial equations in R, the "polyroot" code:

```{r}
polyroot(c(-8, 2, 1))
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
